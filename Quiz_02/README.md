# 💵 AI Dollar Bill Value Detector

An automated image classification system designed to detect and identify the denomination of dollar bills ($1, $5, $10, $20) using a Deep Learning approach.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project addresses the challenge of currency recognition using Computer Vision. After comparing various architectures, a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was implemented to achieve optimal performance on a specialized dataset of 130 images.

### Key Performance Metrics
* **Test Accuracy:** 93.55%
* **Architecture:** Optimized Simple CNN (32-64 Layer Design)
* **Training Time:** 5 Epochs
* **Data Integrity:** Strictly partitioned Train/Test sets with zero data leakage.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository:

```
git clone [https://github.com/Muntazir-43/Computer-VIsion-Quiz-02.git](https://github.com/Muntazir-43/Computer-VIsion-Quiz-02.git)
cd dollar-bill-detector

```
## Install Dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the Model (Optional):
```

## python scripts/train.py
🔍 How to Verify the Model
To test the model with a custom image, use the provided prediction script:

```
python scripts/predict.py

```

The script will output the Predicted Value and the Confidence Score (%) based on the trained weights.

## 🧠 Methodology
The model utilizes a sequence of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers to extract spatial features from the currency images.

Normalization: Pixel values are rescaled to the [0, 1] range.

Classification: A Dense softmax layer outputs probabilities for 4 classes (1, 5, 10, 20).
